# Croptails-pixel

a game about farming to learn the basics of using godot

**`desc from youtube` -**
I've adopted a Test Scene First approach to develop this game, which is a common software design methodology. This approach allows us to build each game system independently, making it easier to focus on designing, developing, and testing these systems before diving into complex levels and the full game build.

By prototyping each component in a test scene, we gain the flexibility to troubleshoot individual systems whenever unexpected behaviors arise, ensuring a smoother development process. Additionally, the rapid prototyping benefits of a test scene approach can significantly accelerate game development.
